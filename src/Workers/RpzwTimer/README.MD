# Raspberry Pi Zero W Timer
A timer using OSX10201-GYR1 as display. 

OSX10201-GYR1 is just a set of 10 LEDs in a case, so it can be replaced with standard leds. The GPIOs are (from left to right - logical/hardware): 25/22, 5/29, 12/32, 6/31, 13/33, 16/36, 19/35, 20/38, 26/37, 21/40. Makes more sense like this:
